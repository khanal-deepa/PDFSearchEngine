To motivate employee: Motivation is creating willingness in individual to give \nhigher effort toward work. This can only be possible when people think or accept \nthat, their need is fulfilled by their effort. Since goal is a outcome and provides an \nidea about what people can achieve in future .It motivates employees towards \n works. \n4. To utilize the resource optimally: Resource can be optimally utilized only when \nthere is precise definition and direction of work with motivated employees. Since \nthere all are for what the goal is meant for. Thus, goal helps in effective utilization \n of resources. \n5. To evaluate and control: Evaluation and control of organizational performance \nis essential to ensure that the organization\u2019s functions are working properly, and \npeople are within the tract (area, band) of budget limit and time schedule. This is \n only possible, when there is goal.", "Types: There are different types of goals formulated by an organization to their \nneeds. They are as follows: \n1. On the basis of level of organization: \ni) Mission: Mission is a statement, which describe the vision of top leadership \nabout organization and provides reason for the existence of an organization. E.g. \n\u201cTo be the best school in Kathmandu valley\u201d may be the mission statement of any \n school situated at Kathmandu. \nii) Strategic goals: It is a long term action plan. It is developed in the view of the  \nmission of an organization .It is a real intension which stated the course of action \nthat is going to be taken by an organization.

They are generally shorter time framed, more specific and \n strongly focused. E.g. 20% increase in sales annually. \niv) Operational goals: Operational goals are unit/section level goals formulated by \nlower level managers. They are more defined and time bound that help to achieve \n the tactical goals. E.g. to produce 100 units of product each day. \n2. On the basis of time horizon: \ni) Long term goals: The goals with a time frame of 5 to 10 years are long term \ngoals. \nii) Intermediate term goals: The goals with a time frame of 2 to 4 years are", "Intermediate term goals. \niii) Short term goals: The goals with a time frame of 1 or below 1 year are short \n term goals. \n3.

Assigning a group: At first a group in which the involvement of all the level of \nmangers from top, middle and lower level are assigned. The involvement of higher \nlevel ensures the utilization of their expertise on environmental changes and \neffective allocation of resources; whereas the involvement of lower level ensures \nthe formulation of realistic and achievable goal and commitment towards the \n work. \n2. Environmental Scanning: After the group is assigned, the necessary and \nrelevant information of internal and external environment are gathered and \nanalyzed. This helps to know the changes occur in external environment like \npolitical changes, technological changes, socio-cultural changes etc. and its \npossible impacts as well as, the strength and weakness of the organization that \n can capitalize the opportunities and neutralize the threats. \n3. Determining and listing the potential goals: After the rigorous analysis of \n environmental factors and its impacts, potential goals are formulated and listed. \n4. Brainstorming on potential goals: Once managers formulated the list of \npotential goals, it is necessary to think deeply on each of them according to their \nimportance. Managers discuss these goals on their relevancy, strength, weakness \n and success in future. \n5. Reach the consequenses: Once the goals are carefully discussed, a best goal \namong the list is choosen. There must be acceptance of majority in goal selection.", "This not only helps to avoid conflict but also helps in motivating the workers \n toward goal achievement. \n6. Determine the major area of responsibility: After finalizing the goal, the \nactivities related to its achievement are determined. In addition, the \nauthority-responsibility relation of the activities and individual are determined \n and assigned the task accordingly.", "Approaches to Goal Formulation: There are mainly three approaches to goal \nformulation. They are as follows: \n1. Top-down approach: Top-down approach is a directive approach.Under this \napproach, top executives first develp the corporate goals and disseminates them \nto middle and lower level managers for implementation. Top level mangers use \n their knowledge and experiences to formulate the goals. \n2. Bottom-Up approach: Bottom-up approach is a participatory approach. Under \nthis approach, functional workers formulate goals for their positions and passes to \nthe top level for final revision and approval. Top level management finalizes the \ngoals on the basis of mission statement and disseminate to lower level for its \n implementation. \n3.

Goal displacement takes place when organizational energies \nand resources are utilized away from the original goals. E.g. an organization shifts \nits business firm manufacturing to trading because of the establishment of many \nmanufacturing organizations and severe competition.", "The reasons for goal displacement are as follows: \n1. Goal Conflict: When organizational goal conflicts with individual goals.", "Employees choose to pursue individual goals. \n2. Abstract goals: When goal are not clearly defined and plans, decision are \ninconsistent with the original goals, then displacement takes place. \n3. Employee attitude: Employee attitude towards goal also lead to goal \ndisplacement. Uncooperative employees and pressure from union association \n weaken the organizational activities needed, which leads to goal displacement.", "Problems of goal formulation: The main problems in goal formulation \nare as follows: \n1. Improper reward system: When there is a weaker link between reward system \nand goal setting, it creates major problem in goal formulation. Employees are \nmotivated only when there is a good relation between goal formulation and \n reward system. \n2. Environmental Constraint: It will be hard to anticipate any changes exactly that \nmay occur in future, which is a major problem in goal formulation. The \nenvironmental factors like technology,politics, etc. force the organization to \nchange its policies and practices. Thus, inadequate assessment of these factors \n may lead to unrealistic and faulty goals. \n3. Unwillingness of managers in goal formulation: Due to lack of knowledge, \nexperiences and confidence, managers may show unwillingness to take part in \n goal setting process. This create problem in goal formulation. \n4. Resistance to change: Goals are formulated to achieve certain changes in \npresent situation. However employees and even managers may resist the changes \nbecause of the fear of job termination, unmatched knowledge of new technology \n etc. This creates problems in goal formulation. \n5. Resource Constraint: Goals are formulated on the basis of backup resources \navailable in an organization. However, inadequacy of such resources may lead to \n unrealistic goals, frustration and goal displacement.", "Changing perspectives (Viewpoint) of organization: The \norganization is defined and viewed differently at different time period. Previously, \nit was only considered as a people gathering place where workers do what the \nemployer asked them to do,there was no concerned about the relation of work \nand people performance. But as the time passes by, the concept of work, workers \nand workplace has been gradually changing. The changing perspectives on \norganization are as follows; \ni) Mechanistic viewpoint on Organization: This perspective states that \norganization as a machine. Many classical theories of organization represent this \nview. It believes on fixed working hours, production schedules, maintenance \nschedules, sales targets etc. These types of organization ignore the human aspects \nand their effectiveness. It does not give priority to imagination, innovation and \n creativity.Thus, this perspective is suitable in stable environment.  \nii) Organization as an Open System: Any organization can be considered as an \nenergy system which has inputs, transformation process and outputs. E.g. the \ninputs for a university would be students, teaching materials, books, money and \nso on. The transformation process would consist of lectures, assignments, \nresearch, study, discussion etc. The output would be educated, cultured and \ndiscipline individuals ready to enter the real world of business or employment. In \ngeneral, the term system is applied to any activity, collection of facts, ideas or \n principles which are so arranged as to present and united as whole.  \niii) Organization as political System: According to this perspective, organizations \nare viewed as \u201ccomplex system of individuals, each having its own interest, \nbeliefs, values, perspectives etc. The union continuously compete with each other \nfor short organizational resources\u201d. It states that organizations are not about \nhierarchies and structures but also about the internal politics that succeed  in \nthem. Understanding and judging an organization from this perspective is \n important to know its current activities and predict its behaviour. \niv) Organization as culture: The organizational cultural perspective states that \nmany organizational behaviour and decisions are predetermined by the pattern of \nbasic assumptions (beliefs, rituals, values) held by the members of an \norganizations. Different studies suggested that, organizational culture acts as \n powerful forces in influencing organizational life. \nv) Organization as a learning system: From this perspective organization is \ndescribed as a living and thinking open system.

The concept of management is \napplicable in all the organizations: private, public, religious, political, business etc.", "It is neceessary to achieve goals effectively and efficiently in dynamic business \nenvironment.", "Characteristics of Management :  The various characteristics of \nmanagement are: \ni) Management is universal: It means that management is required for every type \nof organization. It may be a business organization or social or political. It may be a \nsmall firm or a large one. Management is required by a school or a college or \nuniversity or a hospital or a big firm. Thus, it is a universal phenomenon and is \ncommon and essential element in all organizations. \nii) Management is goal directed: Every organization is created to achieve certain \ngoals. For example, for a business firm it may be to make maximum profit and to \nprovide quality products and services. Management of an organization is always \naimed at achievement of the organizational goals. Success of management is \ndetermined by the extent to which these goals are achieved. \niii) Management is a continuous process: Management is an ongoing process. It \ncontinues as long as the organization exists. No activity can take place without \nmanagement. To perform all activities like production, sale, storage, operation \netc. management is required. So, as long as these activities continue the process \nof management also continues to operate. \niv) Management is an integrating process: All the functions, activities, processes \nand operations are intermixed among themselves. It is the task of management to \nbring them together and proceed in a coordinated manner to achieve desired \nresult. In fact, without integration of men, machine and material and coordination \nof individual efforts to contribute successfully as a team, it will be difficult to \nachieve organizational goals. \nv) Management is intangible: Management is not a place like a graphic showing", "Board meeting or a graphic showing a school Principal at her office desk which can \nbe seen .It is an unseen force and you can feel its presence in the form of rules, \nregulation, output, work climate, etc. \nvi) Management is multi-disciplinary: Management of an organization requires \nwide knowledge about various disciplines as it covers handling of man, machine, \nand material and looking after production, distribution, accounting and many \nother functions. Thus, we find the principles and techniques of management are \nmostly drawn from almost all fields of study like \u2013 Engineering, Economics,", "Sociology, Psychology, Mathematics, Statistics etc. \nvii) Management is a social process: The most important aspect of management \nis handling people organized in work groups. This involves developing and \nmotivating people at work and taking care of their satisfaction as social beings. All \nmanagerial actions are primarily concerned with relations between people and so \nit is treated as a social process. \nviii) Management is situational: The success of management depends on, and \nvaries from, situation to situation. There is no best way of managing. The \ntechniques and principles of management are relative, and do not hold good for \nall situations to come.", "Principles of Management :  Following are the principles of \nmanagement developed by the Henry Fayol: \n1. Division of Work: According to Henry Fayol under division of work, \"The worker \nalways on the same post, the manager always concerned with the same matters, \nacquire an ability, sureness and accuracy which increases their output. In other \nwords, division of work means specialization. According to this principle, a person \nis not capable of doing all types of work. Each job and work should be assigned to \nthe specialist of his job.\"  \n2. Authority and Responsibility: Authority and responsibility go together as the \ntwo sides of a coin. In this way, if anybody is made responsible for any job, he \nshould also have the concerned authority. Fayol's principle of management in this \nregard is that an efficient manager makes best possible use of his authority and \ndoes not escape from the responsibility.  \n3. Discipline: According to Henry Fayol discipline means sincerity about the work \nand enterprise, carrying out orders and instructions of superiors and to have faith \nin the policies and programs of the business enterprise. However, Fayol does not \nadvocate warming, fines, suspension and dismissals of worker for maintaining \ndiscipline. These punishments are rarely awarded. A well disciplined working force \nis essential for improving the quality and quantity of the production. \n4. Unity of Command: A subordinate should take order from only one boss and he \nshould be responsible and accountable to him. Further he claimed that if the unit \nof command is violated, authority is undermined, disciplined in danger, order \ndisturbed and stability threatened. The violation of this principle will face some \nserious consequences. In this way, the principle of unity of command provides the \nenterprise disciplined stable and orderly existence.  \n 5. Fair Remuneration to employees: According to Fayol wage-rates and method \nof their payment should be fair, proper and satisfactory. Both employees and \nex-employers should agree to it. Logical and appropriate wage-rate and methods \nof their payment reduces tension and differences between workers and \nmanagement, create harmonious relationship and a pleasing atmosphere of work.  \n6. Centralization and Decentralization: There should be one central point in the \norganization which exercises overall direction and control of all the parts. But the \ndegree of centralization of authority should vary according to the needs of \nsituation. According to Fayol there should be centralization in small units and \nproper decentralization in big organization. Further, Fayol does not favor \ncentralization or decentralization of authorities but suggests that these should be \nproper and effective adjustment between centralization and decentralization in \norder to achieve maximum objectives of the business.  \n7. Scalar chain: The scalar chain is a chain of supervisors from the highest to the \nlowest rank. An employee should feel the necessity to contact his superior \nthrough the scalar chain. The authority and responsibility is communicated \nthrough this scalar chain. Fayol defines scalar chain as \"the chain of superiors \nranging from the ultimate authority to the lowest rank.\" \n8. Order: According to Fayol there should be proper, systematic and orderly \narrangement of physical and social factors, such as land, raw materials, tools and \nequipments and employees respectively. As per view, there should be safe, \nappropriate and specific place for every article and every place to be used \neffectively for a particular activity and commodity. There should be selection and \nappointment of the most suitable person to every job. There should be specific \nplace for everyone. \n9. Equality: The principle of equality should be followed and applicable at every \nlevel of management. There should not be any discrimination as regards caste, sex \nand religion. An effective management always does sympathetic and human \ntreatment. The management should be kind, honest and impartial with the \nemployees. \n10. Spirit of Co-operation: In order to achieve the best possible results, individual \nand group efforts are to be effectively integrated and coordinated. Production is a \nteam work for which the whole-hearted support and cooperation of the members \nat all levels is required. Everyone should sacrifice his personal interest and \ncontribute his best energies to achieve the best results.", "Process and Functions of Management:  The process of \nmanagement refers to the actions and decisions taken by managers to plan, \norganize, lead, and control the activities of an organization in order to achieve its \ngoals and objectives. The process typically includes five main functions: planning, \norganizing, leading, controlling, and decision making. These functions are \ninterrelated and overlap, and are performed at all levels of the organization. \ni) Planning: Planning is the first step in the process of management. It is the \nprocess of setting goals and objectives for the organization and developing \nstrategies and plans to achieve them. Planning involves determining what the \norganization wants to achieve and how it will achieve it. This includes identifying \nthe resources needed to achieve the goals and objectives, and developing a \ntimeline for when they will be achieved. \nii) Organizing: Organizing is the second step in the process of management. It is \nthe process of arranging and structuring the resources of an organization in order \nto achieve its goals and objectives. This includes identifying the tasks that need to \nbe done, grouping these tasks into departments or teams, and assigning roles and \nresponsibilities to individuals or groups. Organizing also involves determining the \nmost efficient and effective way to use the available resources, such as people, \nmoney, and materials. \niii) Leading: Leading is the third step in the process of management, it refers to \nthe process of motivating and directing individuals or groups to achieve the goals \nand objectives of the organization. Leading involves setting an example, \ncommunicating the organization's goals and objectives, and providing the \nnecessary support and guidance to help individuals or groups achieve these goals.", "It also includes developing and maintaining good relationships with employees, \nand creating a positive work environment. \niv) Controlling: Controlling is the fourth step in the process of management. It is \nthe process of monitoring and evaluating an organization's performance to ensure \nthat it is meeting its goals and objectives. It involves setting standards of \nperformance, measuring actual performance, and making any necessary \nadjustments to keep the organization on track. Controlling includes identifying \npotential problems and taking corrective action to address them. \nv) Decision Making: Decision making is an integral part of the management \nprocess. It is the process of selecting from among alternative courses of action in \norder to achieve a desired outcome. Decision making is an important aspect of the \nmanagement process because it helps managers to make informed and effective \ndecisions that will benefit the organization.", "Managerial hierarchy (Levels of Management):  There are certain \nlevels of management with varying degree of authority and responsibilities. Some \nmanagers decide about the objectives of the business as a whole; some managers \nperform functions to achieve these objectives in different departments, like \nproduction, sales, etc, and some of the managers are concerned with the \nsupervision of day-to-day activities of workers. Managers performing different \ntypes of duties may, thus, be divided into three categories: \n1. Top-Level Management \n2. Middle-Level Management \n3.

Sometimes senior \ndepartmental heads are included in the top management team. The objectives of \nthe business as a whole are translated into departmental objectives for the middle \nlevel management. The heads of the departments then work out their own \nstrategies so as to achieve these objectives. Middle level managers are particularly \nconcerned with the activities of their respective departments.", "The lower-level management consists of foremen and supervisors who look after \nthe operative workers, and ensure that the work is carried out properly and on \ntime. Thus, they have the primary responsibility for the actual production of goods \nand services in the organization.", "Types of Managers: In the principles of management, there are several \ntypes of managers, each with their own responsibilities and roles. The main types \nof managers include: \ni) Top managers: These are the highest level of managers in an organization and \ninclude the CEO, president, and vice presidents. They are responsible for setting \nthe overall strategy and direction of the organization and making major decisions. \nii) Middle managers: These managers are responsible for implementing the \nstrategies and plans set by top managers. They include department heads, division \nmanagers, and branch managers. They are responsible for coordinating the \nactivities of lower-level managers and employees within their specific areas of the \norganization. \niii) Team managers: These managers are responsible for leading a specific team \nwithin an organization. They are responsible for coordinating the activities of the \nteam members and ensuring that they are working together effectively to achieve \nthe goals of the team. \niv) Functional managers: These managers are responsible for managing a specific \nfunctional area of the organization, such as finance, marketing, or human \nresources. They are experts in their specific field and are responsible for managing \nthe activities within their area of expertise. \nv) Project managers: These managers are responsible for managing a specific \nproject or initiative within an organization. They are responsible for coordinating \nthe activities of the project team and ensuring that the project is completed on \ntime, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.", "Managerial skills:  \n1. Technical skill is knowledge and proficiency in activities involving methods, \nprocesses, and procedures. Thus it involves working with tools and specific \ntechniques. For example, mechanics work with tools, and their supervisors should \nhave the ability to teach them how to use these tools. Similarly, accountants apply \nspecific techniques in doing their job. \n2. Human skill is the ability to work with people; it is cooperative effort; it is \nteamwork; it is the creation of an environment in which people feel secure and \nfree to express their opinions. \n3. Conceptual skill is the ability to see the \"big picture,\" to recognize significant \nelements in a situation, and to understand the relationships among the elements. \n4. Design skill is the ability to solve problems in ways that will benefit the \nenterprise. To be effective, particularly at upper organizational levels, managers \nmust be able to do more than see a problem. If managers merely see the problem \nand become \"problem watchers,\" they will fail.", "Managerial roles: \n1) Interpersonal Roles:  \ni) Figure head role: In this role a manager performs symbolic duties required by \nthe status of his office.

Due to \nglobalization, world is consider as the small village. The time and the place gap \nhave been almost overcome by the help of new technologies. There is continuous \nexchange of new ideas, innovations, methods and techniques across nations.This \nbring both opportunities and threat to the business organization.  \nii) Technology: Technology is a major drive that changes the way the people think \nand act in their corresponding environment. Technological advancement in \ncomputers and other electronic data processing equipment have changed the \nwhole system of managerial functions like planning, decision making, organizing, \nmotivating, controlling.  \niii) Quality Assurance and Productivity: In today\u2019s context, quality is considered as \nthe ability to satisfy the customer. However, the human wants are growing and \nproviding the goods and service to satisfy their needs is bigger challenge for a \ntoday\u2019s manager. The product and services must meet the expectation of \ncustomer in terms cost, time, and services delivered within the product.  \niv) Ethics and Social Responsibility: Ethics is concerned with the moral principles \nor values that determine whether our action is right or wrong. Business must \nfollow the ethics in their policies and practices. However, one of the major \nchallenges for our managers is to decide on whether a certain behavior or action \nof employee is ethical or not. Thus, managers must understand the ethical norms \nand values and act accordingly. \nv) Empowerment: Delegating the power to the employees is a major challenge to \nmangers in today\u2019s context. People desire autonomy in their worksites. However, \nineffective handling of such delegation may de-motivate the employees and leads \nto employee turnover, and other problems in work. Thus managers should create \nself-managed teams or autonomous work groups to empower the employees. \nvi) Work-Force Diversity: It refers to the mix of people from various backgrounds \nin terms of gender, race, ethnicity etc in today\u2019s labour force. The participation of \nwomen and minorities has been increasing.Thus, the challenge for a manager is to \naccommodate these diverse groups of people by addressing different lifestyles, \nfamily needs and work styles. \nvii) Learning Organization: Organization must be able to learn from the past and \npresent scenario and formulate policies and practices accordingly.

But as the time passes by, the concept of work, workers \nand workplace has been gradually changing. The changing perspectives on \norganization are as follows; \ni) Mechanistic viewpoint on Organization: This perspective states that \norganization as a machine. Many classical theories of organization represent this \nview. It believes on fixed working hours, production schedules, maintenance \nschedules, sales targets etc. These types of organization ignore the human aspects \nand their effectiveness. It does not give priority to imagination, innovation and \n creativity.Thus, this perspective is suitable in stable environment.  \nii) Organization as an Open System: Any organization can be considered as an \nenergy system which has inputs, transformation process and outputs. E.g. the \ninputs for a university would be students, teaching materials, books, money and \nso on. The transformation process would consist of lectures, assignments, \nresearch, study, discussion etc. The output would be educated, cultured and \ndiscipline individuals ready to enter the real world of business or employment. In \ngeneral, the term system is applied to any activity, collection of facts, ideas or \n principles which are so arranged as to present and united as whole.  \niii) Organization as political System: According to this perspective, organizations \nare viewed as \u201ccomplex system of individuals, each having its own interest, \nbeliefs, values, perspectives etc. The union continuously compete with each other \nfor short organizational resources\u201d. It states that organizations are not about \nhierarchies and structures but also about the internal politics that succeed  in \nthem. Understanding and judging an organization from this perspective is \n important to know its current activities and predict its behaviour. \niv) Organization as culture: The organizational cultural perspective states that \nmany organizational behaviour and decisions are predetermined by the pattern of \nbasic assumptions (beliefs, rituals, values) held by the members of an \norganizations. Different studies suggested that, organizational culture acts as \n powerful forces in influencing organizational life. \nv) Organization as a learning system: From this perspective organization is \ndescribed as a living and thinking open system.

Thus, it is a universal phenomenon and is \ncommon and essential element in all organizations. \nii) Management is goal directed: Every organization is created to achieve certain \ngoals. For example, for a business firm it may be to make maximum profit and to \nprovide quality products and services. Management of an organization is always \naimed at achievement of the organizational goals. Success of management is \ndetermined by the extent to which these goals are achieved. \niii) Management is a continuous process: Management is an ongoing process. It \ncontinues as long as the organization exists. No activity can take place without \nmanagement. To perform all activities like production, sale, storage, operation \netc. management is required. So, as long as these activities continue the process \nof management also continues to operate. \niv) Management is an integrating process: All the functions, activities, processes \nand operations are intermixed among themselves. It is the task of management to \nbring them together and proceed in a coordinated manner to achieve desired \nresult. In fact, without integration of men, machine and material and coordination \nof individual efforts to contribute successfully as a team, it will be difficult to \nachieve organizational goals. \nv) Management is intangible: Management is not a place like a graphic showing", "board meet graphic show school princip offic desk seen unseen forc feel presenc form rule regul output work climat etc vi manag manag organ requir wide knowledg variou disciplin cover handl man machin materi look product distribut account mani function thu find principl techniqu manag mostli drawn almost field studi like engin econom": "Board meeting or a graphic showing a school Principal at her office desk which can \nbe seen .It is an unseen force and you can feel its presence in the form of rules, \nregulation, output, work climate, etc. \nvi) Management is multi-disciplinary: Management of an organization requires \nwide knowledge about various disciplines as it covers handling of man, machine, \nand material and looking after production, distribution, accounting and many \nother functions.

Division of Work: According to Henry Fayol under division of work, \"The worker \nalways on the same post, the manager always concerned with the same matters, \nacquire an ability, sureness and accuracy which increases their output. In other \nwords, division of work means specialization. According to this principle, a person \nis not capable of doing all types of work. Each job and work should be assigned to \nthe specialist of his job.\"  \n2. Authority and Responsibility: Authority and responsibility go together as the \ntwo sides of a coin. In this way, if anybody is made responsible for any job, he \nshould also have the concerned authority. Fayol's principle of management in this \nregard is that an efficient manager makes best possible use of his authority and \ndoes not escape from the responsibility.  \n3. Discipline: According to Henry Fayol discipline means sincerity about the work \nand enterprise, carrying out orders and instructions of superiors and to have faith \nin the policies and programs of the business enterprise. However, Fayol does not \nadvocate warming, fines, suspension and dismissals of worker for maintaining \ndiscipline. These punishments are rarely awarded. A well disciplined working force \nis essential for improving the quality and quantity of the production. \n4. Unity of Command: A subordinate should take order from only one boss and he \nshould be responsible and accountable to him. Further he claimed that if the unit \nof command is violated, authority is undermined, disciplined in danger, order \ndisturbed and stability threatened. The violation of this principle will face some \nserious consequences. In this way, the principle of unity of command provides the \nenterprise disciplined stable and orderly existence.  \n 5. Fair Remuneration to employees: According to Fayol wage-rates and method \nof their payment should be fair, proper and satisfactory. Both employees and \nex-employers should agree to it. Logical and appropriate wage-rate and methods \nof their payment reduces tension and differences between workers and \nmanagement, create harmonious relationship and a pleasing atmosphere of work.  \n6. Centralization and Decentralization: There should be one central point in the \norganization which exercises overall direction and control of all the parts. But the \ndegree of centralization of authority should vary according to the needs of \nsituation. According to Fayol there should be centralization in small units and \nproper decentralization in big organization. Further, Fayol does not favor \ncentralization or decentralization of authorities but suggests that these should be \nproper and effective adjustment between centralization and decentralization in \norder to achieve maximum objectives of the business.  \n7. Scalar chain: The scalar chain is a chain of supervisors from the highest to the \nlowest rank. An employee should feel the necessity to contact his superior \nthrough the scalar chain. The authority and responsibility is communicated \nthrough this scalar chain. Fayol defines scalar chain as \"the chain of superiors \nranging from the ultimate authority to the lowest rank.\" \n8. Order: According to Fayol there should be proper, systematic and orderly \narrangement of physical and social factors, such as land, raw materials, tools and \nequipments and employees respectively. As per view, there should be safe, \nappropriate and specific place for every article and every place to be used \neffectively for a particular activity and commodity. There should be selection and \nappointment of the most suitable person to every job. There should be specific \nplace for everyone. \n9. Equality: The principle of equality should be followed and applicable at every \nlevel of management. There should not be any discrimination as regards caste, sex \nand religion. An effective management always does sympathetic and human \ntreatment. The management should be kind, honest and impartial with the \nemployees. \n10. Spirit of Co-operation: In order to achieve the best possible results, individual \nand group efforts are to be effectively integrated and coordinated.
